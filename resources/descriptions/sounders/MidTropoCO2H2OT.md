# Mid Troposphere CO2/H2O Temperature

This enhancement uses the CO2 and H2O absorption wavelength at 13.66 µm to measure the temperature in the middle part of the troposphere (CO2 is uniformly mixed in the atmosphere).
A color temperature scale enhancement is then used to enable easier analysis.

### Appearance

Low temperature shows as blue, as the temperature increases the color turns to red.

Minimum temperature is 213 K (-60 °C), and maximum temperature is 283 K (10 °C).


### Intended usage

Meteorology.

### Limitations

Excessive water vapor, such as towering cumulonibus clouds, can result in an abnormally low temperature.
