# DNB Night - Arctic FC

### Appearance

Dark areas appear black; brighter areas gradually transition to purple, blue, green, then finally white.

### Intended usage

Non-quantitative presentation. Auroras and clouds stand out.

### Limitations

Owing to a lack of instrument calibration (for now):
* Very strong auroras might saturate into a solid white color.
* Purplish hues might bleed into dark areas.
