# Day Clouds Convection

This enhancement increases the visibility of cloud-top convection features and overall contrast on the cloud, at the expense of land masses.

It is also usable on APT, but only on NOAA-18 as it needs both channel 1 and channel 4.

### Appearance

Land appears yellow (without vegetation) to violent/bluish (with vegetation)
Clouds appear whitish-blue with yellow hues
Fog appears whitish-gray.

### Intended usage

Cloud analysis

### Limitations

Low contrast on land
