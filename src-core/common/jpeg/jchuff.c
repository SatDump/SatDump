/*
 * Generate the best Huffman code table for the given counts, fill htbl.
 *
 * The JPEG standard requires that no symbol be assigned a codeword of all
 * one bits (so that padding bits added at the end of a compressed segment
 * can't look like a valid code).  Because of the canonical ordering of
 * codewords, this just means that there must be an unused slot in the
 * longest codeword length category.  Section K.2 of the JPEG spec suggests
 * reserving such a slot by pretending that symbol 256 is a valid symbol
 * with count 1.  In theory that's not optimal; giving it count zero but
 * including it in the symbol set anyway should give a better Huffman code.
 * But the theoretically better code actually seems to come out worse in
 * practice, because it produces more all-ones bytes (which incur stuffed
 * zero bytes in the final file).  In any case the difference is tiny.
 *
 * The JPEG standard requires Huffman codes to be no more than 16 bits long.
 * If some symbols have a very small but nonzero probability, the Huffman tree
 * must be adjusted to meet the code length restriction.  We currently use
 * the adjustment method suggested in JPEG section K.2.  This method is *not*
 * optimal; it may not choose the best possible limited-length code.  But
 * typically only very-low-frequency symbols will be given less-than-optimal
 * lengths, so the code is almost optimal.  Experimental comparisons against
 * an optimal limited-length-code algorithm indicate that the difference is
 * microscopic --- usually less than a hundredth of a percent of total size.
 * So the extra complexity of an optimal algorithm doesn't seem worthwhile.
