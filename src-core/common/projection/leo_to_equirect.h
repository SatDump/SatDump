/*
Implementation of a function capable of plotting LEO satellite image (or anything that
can be done with a LEOScanProjector) to an equirectangular projection for easier viewing.
This has some known defects right now such as leaving gaps in the image. It's something I
will have to fix at some point... Still thinking about the best approach :-)
